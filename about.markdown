Let's learn how to build a website using Ruby on Rails ... for cats running a farm

The posts are best read in order if you want to follow along with making a website using Ruby on Rails to help some cats run a farm. I hope to expand them into a book.

This site is run by Jon Evans. You can say hi on Twitter at [@jon_evans](https://twitter.com/jon_evans). By day, I am a developer at [Bonusly](https://bonus.ly), making work places more pleasant by letting employees recognize each other for doing good work.
